# Voice Recognition Calculator - Android Application

## Overview

This project was built as a final year project for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As a developer having skills in both mobile and web applications is a plus.

I built this project using Android Studio and Java. A user can interact with the calculator in both type and voice(using Google'speech-to-text API) and the result is evaluated using 3rd party library.
